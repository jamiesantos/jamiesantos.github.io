abstract: This work presents AstrobeeCD, a system for 3D scene change detection toward near-real-time environmental awareness of space outposts using the Astrobee free-flying robot in microgravity. Assistive free-flyer robots autonomously caring for future crewed space habitats must be able to detect day-to-day interior changes to track inventory, detect and diagnose faults, and monitor the outpost status. A set of image and depth data from one time step is used to reconstruct a 3D model of the environment. The 3D model is used as the basis for comparison for free-flyer environment surveys at future time steps, where an image-based change detection algorithm identifies inconsistencies against the 3D model. Change detection is demonstrated using real image and pose data collected by an Astrobee robot in a test environment on Earth at NASA Ames Research Center and from microgravity aboard the International Space Station. Change detection computation time and performance are quantitatively evaluated on the test data captured on Earth, and it identifies scene changes more quickly than a point cloud clustering-based algorithm applied to data from the same surveys.
